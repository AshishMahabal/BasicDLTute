Basic Deep Learning Tutorial with astronomy data

- Open the BasicDL.ipynb in Google Colab
- Copy the data.tgz to Google Drive
- Untar the data.tgz file (this is not strictly needed if you change the python code appropriately, but this way you can also look at individual images directly on drive)
- Change path in notebook to reflect where on the drive you have stored the file.
- Run

Play around with hyperparameters
