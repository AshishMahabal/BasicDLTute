# Basic DL Tute (7BISS)
Basic Deep Learning Tutorial with astronomy data

- Open the BasicDL.ipynb in Google Colab (download and upload if required)
- Copy the data.tgz to Google Drive
- Untar the data.tgz file on Drive (this is not strictly needed if you change the python code appropriately, but this way you can also look at individual images directly on drive)
- Change path in notebook to reflect where on the drive you have stored the file
- In Google Colab change the Runtime to GPU (Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU)
- Run the cells

Play around with hyperparameters
